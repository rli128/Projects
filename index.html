                <h2>Hi, I'm Ricky!</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a 4th year computer engineering student at UC San Diego with an interest in Firmware and Digital Design. Over the summer I was mentored by Zhengyu Li with the System Energy Efficiency Lab at UCSD run by professor Tajana Rosing where Zhengyu and I worked on optimizing our hyperdimensional computing machine. I am proficient in both C/C++ and HDL like SystemVerilog where I have multiple projects that showcase my familiarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time I enjoy being active by playing sports, running, and going to the gym. I also enjoy cooking and baking and enjoy exploring new recipes.
                </p>
