            <p>
                I'm a 4th year computer engineering student at UC San Diego with a passion for designing efficient systems and solving complex problems. 
                With experience in machine learning, digital design, and web development, I enjoy working on diverse projects.
            </p>

                In my free time I enjoy being active, playing sports, running. I also enjoy cooking and baking.
